# Conferences
The first known use of "conference" appears in 1527, meaning "a meeting of two or more persons for discussing matters of common concern". It came from the word "confer", which means "to compare views or take counsel".
The [conference](https://instanteventsapp.com) provides an opportunity for everyone to network, exchange ideas and present their research to the international community. The discussion on the latest innovations, achievements, trends, practical problems and challenges they face in these areas is also encouraged.
